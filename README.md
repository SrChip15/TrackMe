# Habit Tracker App Project
The application helps an user to log and track habits that the user may wish to form. It is built around two screens, splash 
screen and habit edit screen. The splash screen lists all the habits that the user has saved to the database with up-to-date 
information. The habit edit screen lets the user enter the description of the habit and also increment the days that the user has
completed performed the said habit.

This app has been built to the specifications of the tour guide app project rubric, which is part of the 
Data Storage module of [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).
