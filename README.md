Habit Tracker App Project
====

The application helps an user to log and track habits that the user may wish to form. It is built around two screens, splash 
screen and habit edit screen. The splash screen lists all the habits that the user has saved to the database with up-to-date 
information. The habit edit screen lets the user enter the description of the habit and also increment the days that the user has performed the said habit.
